## Installation
You can download latest version [here](https://github.com/exelban/stats/releases).

### Homebrew

```bash
brew cask install stats
```

## Requirements

Stats is currently supported on macOS 10.14 (Mojave) and higher.

## Features
Stats is a application which allows you to monitor your macOS system.  

 - CPU Usage
 - Memory Usage
 - Disk utilization
 - Sensors information (Temperature/Voltage/Power)
 - Battery level
 - Network usage

## Troubleshoots
The application supports a few arguments which can help to work with Stats. Also, it's very helpful to debug what module is not working properly (crash).

There are 2 arguments available:

- `--reset`: allows to reset application settings
- `--disable`: allow to disable some of the modules. A list of modules can be passed. (Example: `--disable disk`)
